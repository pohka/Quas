* addCompAsChild() - construct a component and add it as a child when declaring data, it also had to call the render() from the new child component
* Quas.addChild("selector", data, type)
* Add event listener to existing element
* fix ajax request to work with $_POST and $_GET
* states, start -> loading -> finished rendering -> ready
* addCookie(key,value,date,directory)
* Add multiple event listeners at the same time i.e. "click keyup change paste"
* Rather than element being a wrapper object, make prototype functions if possible

* Playground
